Contains two scripts: sgpa.sh and cgpa.sh
Call as
./sgpa.sh result.pdf semester
./cgpa.sh result_for_s1.pdf result_for_s2.pdf

./sgpa.ch take two command line arguments.
    1) the file name ofor the result of MEC.
    2) the semister to be which evaluated.

./cgpa.sh takes two command line argumets 
    1)the file name containing the result of the S1 result of MEC
    2) the file name containing the result of the S2 result of MEC.

APPROACH TO CALCULATE THE SGPA

    1) the first command line agrument is the filename of the result file.and the second command line agrument is the semister number.
    2) the cs student list is searched out using grep and is inserted into a new file named cs.
    3) the new file conatin the regNo and mark for 8 subjext in one line and the mark for the 9th subject in the next line.
    4) create a array for the credit considering the second command line argument (ie. the semister number). and inputing the cs text to case.
    5) read each line from cs text. for each word check if it is of form 'MDL16CS*' if yes , then register number =word. else get the grade using '(' and ')' as delimiters. (by using the cut tool). calculate the grade point using the case in. 
    6) calculate the sgpa.
    7) the lcount is used to consider both of the lines.(as the 9th subject's grade was in the next line ).
    8)finally remove the file cs.
NOTE: the tool bc is used to get the correct precission output (eg : bc -l <<<8.5 will return 8.5 itself)
